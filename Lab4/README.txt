Lab 4: Sorting Integers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, the user enters up to eight hexadecimal values into the program
arguments. The entries can range from 0x0 to 0xFFF. The program will then 
print the hexadecimal entries to the screen as they were entered. Then, the 
program will convert the entries to decimal numbers and print them to the 
screen. Finally, the program will sort the values into ascending order and
print them to the screen in that order.
